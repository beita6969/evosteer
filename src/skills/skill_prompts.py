GENERATE_SKILL_PROMPT = """You are a skilled AI agent architect. Analyze the trajectory and extract a reusable Standard Operating Procedure (SOP).

### Guiding Principles:
1. **Learn from Success and Failure**: Compare the successful and failed trajectories using only outcome/reward metadata.
   - From successful patterns: Extract the effective workflows and tool sequences.
   - From failed attempts or near-misses: Note what went wrong and why - these lessons are often more valuable.
2. **Keep It General**: Use placeholders instead of specific values from this trajectory. The skill should apply to ANY similar problem, not just this one.
   - For QA tasks: `[ENTITY]`, `[QUERY]`, `[KEYWORD]`, `[RELATIONSHIP]`
   - For math tasks: `[EQUATION]`, `[VARIABLE]`, `[EXPRESSION]`, `[CONSTRAINT]`, `[FORMULA]`
   - For code tasks: `[FUNCTION_NAME]`, `[INPUT_SPEC]`, `[ALGORITHM]`, `[DATA_STRUCTURE]`
   - NEVER include specific names, numbers, equations, or code from this trajectory.
3. **Capture Executable Knowledge**: Extract the core tool usage patterns as reusable templates. Focus on WHICH TOOLS to use in WHAT ORDER — this is more valuable than describing the problem.
4. **Brevity Matters**: Aim for ~500 words. Focus on what's actionable.

### Available Tools:
The AI Supervisor has these tools:
- **skill_invoke**: Invoke a learned strategy from the skill library (core SkillFlow mechanism)
- **think**: Quick reasoning without calling executor
- **plan**: Have the Executor create a step-by-step plan
- **decompose**: Break complex problem into 2-3 sub-questions
- **python_execute**: Have the Executor write and run Python code (math via sympy, numerical via numpy)
- **test_code**: Have the Executor write a function, run against test cases
- **analyze**: Have the Executor analyze data or reason about a specific aspect
- **search**: Search context passages by BM25+semantic hybrid matching
- **lookup**: Look up a keyword in previously retrieved documents
- **fact_verify**: Verify a claim against context passages (SUPPORTED/NOT_SUPPORTED/PARTIAL)
- **ask_llm**: Ask a powerful LLM to directly answer based on gathered evidence
- **self_consistency**: Generate 3 independent solutions, return majority answer
- **verify_answer**: Verify candidate answer by substitution/testing
- **check_answer**: Quick sanity check on answer format and plausibility
- **cross_validate**: Solve using a different method, compare with candidate
- **search_code**: Search for patterns in the code workspace (SWE tasks)
- **view_file**: View file contents in the code workspace
- **edit_file**: Edit a file by replacing content
- **run_tests**: Run test commands in the code workspace
- **act**: Execute an action in an interactive environment (ALFWorld)
- **search_product**: Search products in WebShop environment
- **click**: Click an element in WebShop environment
- **accept**: Submit final answer

# [Skill Title]

## When to Use
- **Task patterns**: [what kinds of questions or problems, using generic descriptions]
- **Key signals**: [what clues in the question indicate this approach]

## Strategy Overview
[1-2 sentences on the core approach]

## Workflow
1. **[Phase Name]**: [Action using specific tool and rationale]
2. **[Phase Name]**: [Action and rationale]
3. ...

## Tool Templates
(Include only if the trajectory contained useful tool usage patterns)

- **[Tool] - [Purpose]**:
  `[tool_name]("[QUERY/TARGET placeholder]")`

## Watch Out For
- [Common mistake or trap observed in the trajectory, generalized]
```

### Input:
<successful_trajectory>
{success_trajectory}
</successful_trajectory>

<failed_trajectory>
{failure_trajectory}
</failed_trajectory>

<outcome_summary>
{outcome_summary}
</outcome_summary>

Learn from BOTH trajectories: the successful one shows what works, the failed one shows what to avoid.
Use outcome/reward metadata to diagnose failure patterns (wrong format? unsupported conclusion? gave up?) without copying any training label.
Output ONLY the SKILL.md content starting with `---`. Do NOT include any specific names, dates, numbers, or answers from the trajectories — use [PLACEHOLDER] notation instead."""


MERGE_SKILL_PROMPT = """You are a knowledge architect. Your job is to maintain a single, unified skill document for {task_type} tasks that grows wiser with each new case.

### Philosophy:
Think of this as a living document. Each new skill brings potential insights — your task is to integrate them thoughtfully, not mechanically.

### Integration Strategy:
For each part of the new skill, ask:
- **Is this part better?** → Rewrite the existing version
- **Is this part redundant or too specific?** → Delete it
- **Is this part complementary?** → Merge into a more general form
- **Is this part genuinely different?** → Add as a variant workflow (but consolidate if possible)

### Quality Guidelines:
- Preserve concrete, reusable tool usage templates and patterns
- Delete overly specific examples and cases that don't apply to similar problems
- Replace any specific names, numbers, or answers with [PLACEHOLDER] notation
- Consolidate similar trigger phrases
- If workflows differ only in minor details, merge them into one with noted variations

### Length Budget:
- Target: ~800 words
- If growing too long: merge similar workflows, trim verbose explanations
- Maximum 4 variant workflows - if you have more, they likely can be consolidated

### Available Tools:
skill_invoke, think, plan, decompose, python_execute, test_code, analyze, search, lookup, fact_verify, ask_llm, self_consistency, verify_answer, check_answer, cross_validate, search_code, view_file, edit_file, run_tests, act, search_product, click, accept

### Input:
<existing_skill>
{existing_skill}
</existing_skill>

<new_skills>
{new_skills}
</new_skills>

Output ONLY the merged SKILL.md starting with `---`. No preamble. Use [PLACEHOLDER] notation for any specific values."""


SKILL_REFINE_PROMPT = """You are a skill document architect. Refine the SKILL.md to remove redundancy, generalize specific cases, and improve structure.

### Current Stats:
- Word count: {word_count}
- Task type: {task_type}

### Refinement Goals:

1. **Remove Redundancy**:
   - Merge duplicate or near-duplicate content across sections
   - Eliminate repeated explanations that appear in multiple places
   - Consolidate overlapping concepts into single, clearer statements

2. **Avoid Too Specific Cases**:
   - Replace overly specific examples with generalizable patterns
   - Convert hardcoded values to placeholders (e.g., `[TARGET]`, `[QUERY]`, `[ENTITY]`)
   - Delete task-specific details or specific cases that don't apply to similar problems
   - Remove case-specific training details (specific question text, answers, names)

3. **Logical Consolidation**:
   - Merge workflows that share substantial overlap into variants
   - Extract common preliminary steps into dedicated sections
   - Group related tool templates and patterns together
   - Consolidate similar pitfalls into broader categories

4. **Format Optimization**:
   - Ensure consistent structure: When to Use → Workflow → Tool Templates → Watch Out For
   - Make workflows easier to scan (clear steps, consistent formatting)
   - Organize content from general principles → specific techniques

5. **Content Quality**:
   - Keep description concise and focused on core purpose
   - Ensure all content is actionable and reusable
   - Remove verbose explanations that don't add value
   - Maintain the most essential and distinctive elements

### Principles:
- Prioritize generalizability over specificity
- Keep what enables reuse across similar problems
- Remove what only applies to one particular case
- Maintain clarity and actionability
- Target ~600 words after refinement

Output ONLY the refined SKILL.md starting with `---`. No preamble.
